          I like to spend my time learning new things/solving problems. Other
          than that, maybe hanging out with friends, going on an occasional walk
          and looking around.

        <p>
          Working on projects is the most enjoyable part of learning, where I
          can best figure out the details. So far, I have dived into graphics
          heavy projects, which are cool to visualize, and more recently,
          front-end related projects such as designing a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Favorite projects I&apos;ve done include developing this website,
          implementing an RTree, RRT path planning algorithm, and a 3D
          reconstruction algorithm.

          I started off in math, but decided cs would be more fun, especially
          because of the blend of theory and hands on application that comes
          with a computer science degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Math courses were very enjoyable to take, as there were often
          cool/powerful ideas and techniques used. Interestingly, many of the
          courses were self-contained and content was built from the ground up.
        </p>
        <p>
          CS courses were much more applied and putting the theory into practice
          was definitely a challenge. It was rewarding to finish a project and
          see the components fit nicely together.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the very applied side of the spectrum is electrical engineering. It
          had some very cool applications, but it I found that higher-level
          programming was more fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other courses outside of these topics were a breath of fresh air. I
          particularly found an intro to biology course and french course to be
          engaging and memorable.

          I grew up most of my life learning the piano, but have taken up other
          things on the side for added fun. Cooking is fun at times, especially
          if I have some free time. For some reason I find baking more
          enjoyable.
