        <h2>Path Planning</h2>
        <p>
          RRT represents a class of methods (Rapidly exploring Random Trees) to
          finding an optimal path within a given free space from one point to
          another. It is often used in planning robotic motion constrained
          motion problems due to its flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started the project as an application to a club, but worked on it
          after as a passion project, and it provided a nice introduction to
          researching and implementing algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core idea is to sample the free space and attempt to grow the tree
          from the root (starting point) to the sampled point by a chosen step
          size. Over many iterations, the tree will flood the free space and a
          solution will be found.

          The algorithm makes heavy use of finding the nearest neighbor to the
          sampled point, and so spatial indexing is often used as a speed up.
          There are many trees that can be used for indexing, but I chose to
          implement RTrees due to its flexibility, mainly, its ability to handle
          objects outside of just points. This becomes handy when dealing with
          meshes for fast obstacle collision detection.

          The simple implementation is not very effective however, as the path
          is not optimal in terms of length. It is also not effective in
          maneuvering small spaces:

          As it fails to find the optimal path in a maze. One of these problems
          can be tackled with rrt*, a variant which adjusts the wiring of the
          new node to the tree. Rather than selecting the closest neighbor to
          the sampled node, we select the tree node in a neighborhood of the
          nearest neighbor. The cost function will determing the parent node,
          and the metric used is the distance from the sampled node to the root
          of the tree,

        </ImageContainer>
        <p>
          We can see that the distance from the root to the leaf nodes are
          shortened substantially.

          There are many other variants, and here is a list and some details of
          the ones I implemented:

        <aside>
          <details>
            <summary>RRT Connect</summary>
            <p>
              A bidirectional form of rrt where two trees are grown, one from
              the start and one from the goal point.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Informed RRT*</summary>
            <p>
              After the initial RRT* solution has been found, sampling is
              restrained to an ellipsoid, for faster convergence to the
              solution.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Quick RRT</summary>
            <p>
              Similar to RRT* but we also consider the ancestors in the rewiring
              method of RRT*. By doing this, we decrease the depth of the tree,
              making the path more linear.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>EP RRT</summary>
            <p>
              Similar to Informed RRT* but we sample within a given radius to
              our solution path for faster convergence to the solution.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>BTO RRT</summary>
            <p>
              This makes two modifications. One is the connect heuristic, branch
              from RRT Connect. Rather than having both trees grow to each
              other&apos;s roots, one tree grows to the other&apos;s root, while
              the other grows towards the most recently appended node, which
              acts sort of like a flag.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second modification is the post processing of the path. The
              path is downsampled to get a tighter solution, and interpolated
              with a parametric spline for path smoothing. We then clamp our
              path with keypoints to ensure that no collision is added during
              the interpolation.
            </p>

          Overall, it was a very fun and rewarding project to work on. Here are
          some cool animations of visualizing the solution path.
